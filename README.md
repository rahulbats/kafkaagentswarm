# kafkaagentswarm

A Kubernetes operator for running multi-agent AI workflows as a DAG of Kafka-connected workers, with no central coordinator process.

## Description

Most agent-swarm frameworks route every step through a central orchestrator: a process that holds the workflow state, decides which agent runs next, and hands off results between them. That coordinator is a single point of failure and a scaling bottleneck — every agent's throughput is capped by how fast the coordinator can dispatch work, and if it goes down, the whole swarm stalls mid-task. This project takes the position (explored in [this write-up](https://medium.com/@rahulbats/agent-swarms-on-kafka-coordination-without-a-coordinator-d358c61196b4)) that coordination logic belongs in the messaging layer, not in a bespoke controller process: each agent is an independent Kafka consumer/producer that reacts to events on its input topic and emits results to its output topic, and the *topology* — who talks to whom — is just the topic wiring between them. `kafkaagentswarm` implements this as a Kubernetes CRD (`AgentSwarm`): you declare a DAG of nodes (with `dependsOn` edges for fan-out/fan-in, and `HumanInTheLoop` nodes as manual-approval gates), and the operator reconciles that spec into Kafka topics and worker Deployments — no coordinator service to run, deploy, or fail.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.6+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kafkaagentswarm:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kafkaagentswarm:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/kafkaagentswarm:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/kafkaagentswarm/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v2-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.
